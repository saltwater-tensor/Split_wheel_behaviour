% INPUT ARGUMENTS
% frame_state - frame state number that tells whether the frame on the
% basis of which classification of the current frame has to take place has
% one bbox or two
%j - the i-kth frame which has been found such that it contains only either
%a single bounding box or two bboxes 
%condition - as this is a generic function that caters to two conditions 
%a) the one in which the current frame has only one bbox to classify
%b) the one in which the current frame has more than one bbox to classify
%that will require averaging
